# Semantic Role Labeling
This project addresses the issue of Semantic Role Labeling (SRL)  using Attention mechanism and Transformer architecture. Our specific goal was to identify the arguments of the predicates in different sentences and associate each argument with its class. We used GloVe for word embedding and created multiple embedding layers in order to feed data with more features and improve the results. The best F1-scores we garnered for the tasks of argument identification and classification were 90.62 and 85.74, respectively.
